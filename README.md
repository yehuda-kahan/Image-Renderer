# Image-Render
This software allows you to create an image by placing the elements that make up the image, such as a triangular sphere and a plane.
And also by placing the lighting fixtures in the desired places and determining their color.
The software works on the principle of sending rays from the camera to the scene,
and by calculating the points of intersection of the rays, color the pixels of the image accordingly.
