# Image Render
This software allows the creation of an image by placing elements that build the scene of an image and a camera that takes a shot of the sense.

The elements are shapes with their colors and lights. 

The software works on the principle of sending rays from the camera to the scene, calculating the points of intersection of the rays, and coloring the pixels of the image accordingly.
